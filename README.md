# AVData-NeuralNet
This neural network runs on NTSB flight safety data, and attempts find a relationship between the severity of aviation accidents, and the events that took place on the flight. It uses the Theano deep learning framework with a Keras frontend API. This implementation achieved an 86% accuracy on its test dataset.
